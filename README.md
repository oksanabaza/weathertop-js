<h1>‚òÅÔ∏è Overview</h1>
<p>User Authentication: WeatherTopJS offers a secure user authentication system that allows users to sign up for new accounts or log in to existing ones. This ensures that each user has a personalized experience and can access their data securely.</p>
<p>Station Management: Users can create and manage weather stations. These stations serve as data collection points and are displayed on an interactive map. Users can easily view the geographical distribution of their weather stations.</p>
<p>Weather Data Collection: Within each weather station, users can manually input weather readings, providing detailed weather information for specific locations. Alternatively, they can automatically generate readings by making API calls to a weather API. This feature allows users to gather up-to-date and accurate weather data.</p>
<p>Data Manipulation: Users have the flexibility to edit their personal information, weather stations, and individual weather readings. This empowers them to maintain their data accuracy and relevance over time.</p>
